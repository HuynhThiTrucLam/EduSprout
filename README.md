# EduSprout

A modern web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (version 1.0 or higher recommended)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Bun requires Node.js to be installed)

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

   This will start the app locally, usually at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

3. **Build for production:**

   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

   The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

4. **Preview the production build locally:**

   ```bash
   bun run preview
   ```

   This serves the built app locally for testing.

5. **Lint the codebase:**

   ```bash
   bun run lint
   ```

   This will check the code for linting errors using ESLint.

6. **Login Account**

   Email:

   ```bash
   john.doe@example.com"

   Password:

   ```bash
